# Coding Challenges
This repo is made to hold a collection of small simple projects.  The projects should be small enough to be done in a few hours.

## Highlights
### [Caffeine Calculator](https://github.com/cartwatson/coding-challenges/tree/main/caffeine_calculator)  
A simple calculator for a Hackathon to make sure that you are properly caffeinated
#### Ideas to extend it
* create a graph of the level of caffeine over time  
* find a way to show whether the caffeine intake was over the recommended limit
